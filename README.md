# 🗓️ CalendarHub

A modular calendar application built entirely from scratch using vanilla JavaScript.

CalendarHub focuses on **scalable architecture**, **state synchronization**, and advanced **event management systems**, including recurring events, runtime occurrence generation, contextual UI interactions, synchronized multi-view rendering, and date-based ToDo list management.

The project is designed as a long-term architecture-focused application rather than a simple CRUD calendar demo.

## 🧩 Core Architecture

CalendarHub uses a centralized synchronization flow to keep all calendar views aligned.

The main calendar views:

* Month
* Week
* Daily
* Mini calendar

share a common date state and rendering logic, allowing the interface to stay synchronized when the user changes view, selects dates, creates events, edits events, manages recurring events, or opens contextual UI elements.

The goal of this architecture is to:

* Maintain UI consistency
* Avoid duplicated rendering logic
* Simplify future scalability
* Keep all views synchronized automatically

---

## 🔁 Recurring Event System

CalendarHub includes a recurring event system designed to avoid storing every generated occurrence separately.

Instead of saving each repeated event as an independent item, the application stores the original recurring event and dynamically generates its visible occurrences at runtime before rendering them across the calendar views.

The recurring system supports daily, weekly, monthly and custom repetitions, including intervals, end dates, and multiple selected weekdays.

Recurring events also support an exception-based flow. When a single occurrence is edited or deleted, CalendarHub preserves the original recurring series and stores the specific change as an exception. This keeps the recurring chain consistent while still allowing individual occurrences to behave differently when needed.

This approach keeps recurring events scalable, flexible and easier to synchronize across Month, Week and Daily views.

## ✅ ToDo List System

Version 0.9 introduces a date-based ToDo List system integrated with the calendar.

Users can create ToDo lists for selected days, add activities, mark items as completed, delete individual items, delete full lists, and reopen saved lists from calendar indicators.

The system supports:

* localStorage persistence
* multiple ToDo lists for the same day
* saved list rehydration
* item completion tracking
* automatic progress counter
* indicators in Month, Week and Daily views
* contextual menu for reopening saved lists

The ToDo system is integrated into the calendar date flow without duplicating the core calendar logic.

## 🧭 Tutorial System

CalendarHub includes an onboarding tutorial designed to explain the main features of the application.

Version 0.9 improves the tutorial with:

* Semantic modal structure
* Chapter-based navigation
* Active chapter highlighting
* Updated tutorial content
* ToDo List explanation
* Restart option from the navigation bar
