# üß© Version 0.1 ‚Äì Calendar App (October 2025)

## üìù Description
This version finally has **month view**, **week view**, **daily view** fully synchronized. All the bugs from the previous versions have been fixed. 
The entire project is now flexible to a change in **date format**, thanks to a feature provide by the **Dayjs** library ([day.js.org](https://day.js.org/)). All the files inside the project's folder, have been reorganized for a clear and compact structure.

## üí¨ Personal Notes
The biggest challenge in this version was synchronizing the three views. To achieve this, I had to refactor all the code inside utils.js using classes. Working with classes was quite intuitive, but it helped me grow significantly in understanding the logic behind JavaScript.
I also encountered issues with the date format. Initially, I tried to force the Italian format using only the English format and Day.js plugins, but this approach proved inconsistent.
I decided to rewrite the logic in the monthly functions and in the week view switch function, making it more coherent and flexible. This also allowed me to fix existing bugs and introduce a new feature: the ability to switch the date format, which will be fully implemented in a future version.
Finally, I rewrote the initial offset calculation logic. At first, I used the function suggested by ChatGPT, but I reformulated it to make it consistent with the rest of the JS library usage. This makes the code modular and allows the calendar to adapt properly. It was a great exercise in problem solving and helped prevent errors in some edge cases.
