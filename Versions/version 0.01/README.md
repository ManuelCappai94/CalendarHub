# 🧩 Version 0.01 – Calendar App (September /  2025)

## 📝 Description
This is the first iteration of my calendar project. The tecnoligies  I used are **HTML** and **CSS**.  Before implementing the JS logic, I wanted to designed a facsimile version, to get an idea of how the final project could look. 
This first version contains 1500 rows of HTML code.

## ⚙️ What's inside
the  `v0.01` folder contains the drafts of:
- month view;
- week view;
- daily view;
- to-do-app;

The UI, colors, and stucture are incomplete.

## 📅 next version (v0.02)
- Refactor part of the code (month view)  
- Begin writing the logic for the month view  
- Redesign the UI

## 💬 Personal Notes
> This is my first project, and I faced some challenges with CSS, especially understanding how `display: flex` and `display: grid` work.  
> Thanks to this draft, I can say that I have **improved a lot in CSS**.
